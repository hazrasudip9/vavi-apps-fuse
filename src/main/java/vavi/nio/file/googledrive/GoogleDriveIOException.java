 * Class used as a wrapper over the GoogleDrive API's unchecked exceptions when

 * The problem mainly comes from {@link File} and {@link
 * File}. Both of these methods define a {@code close()} method
 * but none of them implement {@link Closeable}. Worse than that, at least as
 * far as the uploader is concerned, this method is not even idempotent, and all
 * exceptions it throws are <strong>unchecked</strong>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The file system API, however, needs "correct" {@link IOException}s to be
 * thrown. We therefore capture all {@link RuntimeException}s thrown by either a
 * downloader or an uploader, and wrap it into such an exception.
